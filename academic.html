							<p1>Launching into the World of Wisdom:</p1>

							<p1>Quiz Champion: A Science Quiz Triumph:</p1>
							<p> The pinnacle of my academic experience was marked by a notable achievement -> a first prize in a Science quiz conducted by IEEE forum at Sathyabama University.

							<p1>Class of 2013: BE Graduation unsung Anthem:</p1>
							<p>In the dynamic tapestry of my academic journey, the Class of 2013 holds a unique melody.
							As a shy, reserved introvert, wearing the cloak of determination on the graduation day, I navigated challenges throughout my university years. 
							The path to graduation didn't unfold in the traditional ceremony. 
							Yet, within this unconventional tale lies a testament to tenacity and resilience. 
							In the year 2013, armed with a degree earned through persistence, I stepped into the vast realms of Information Technology, proving that success, though delayed, is ultimately inevitable.
