							<p1>Linux Sage in Making </p1>
							<p>In the nascent stages of my career, I immersed myself into the project shared services.
								My expertise flourished as I navigated the intricate terrain of Linux Server Administration,
								meticulously orchestrated JBoss deployments, and executed other maintenance routines.
								The symphony of my skills crescendoed in the realm of shell scripting, where I crafted elegant solutions to intricate problems.
								My role extended beyond routine support; I spearheaded tech refresh migrations, orchestrating the evolution of systems with finesse.
								This multifaceted experience sculpted me into a Support Specialist with an unparalleled ability to harmonize various technologies,
								ensuring the uninterrupted rhythm of project success. </p>
							<p1>Communication Catalyst: Transforming Struggles into Prowess</p1>
							<p> Embarking on a riveting and transformative escapade in incident management,
								I unearthed the craft of troubleshooting and the might of seamless coordination.
								From choreographing resolutions to articulating with finesse in top-tier bridge calls,
								each hurdle unfolded as a fertile ground for personal evolution.</p>
							<p1>From Incidents to Innovation: The Evolution in Technical Expertise</p1>
							<p>Transitioning from incident management, I seamlessly integrated back into the Unix Technical Services through an internal transfer.
								In this dynamic role, I spearheaded Linux server administration, executed meticulous Linux change management, and orchestrated seamless patching.
								My toolkit expanded to include the mastery of shell scripting,
								precision with Ansible, the agility of Python scripting, and the automation finesse of Jenkins.</p>
							<p1>Devops Jedi: Mastering Automation in Continuous Integration</p1>
							<p>In my current role, I am at the forefront of a pivotal project, steering the ship of build and release operations.
								I wield the finesse of shell scripting and Linux expertise, scripting pathways to perfection.
								Python automation becomes my symphony, orchestrating efficiency with surgical precision.
								Jenkins, the heartbeat of our continuous integration, bows to my command, automating processes with the precision of a maestro.
								Travis and Concourse, my dynamic allies, synchronize the dance of release processes, each step choreographed for optimal performance.
								In the realm of containers, Docker becomes my artistic brush, encapsulating applications for scalable deployment.
								My command over Kubernetes orchestrates a ballet of efficiency, ensuring each release is a seamless performance of technical mastery.
							And Now started new Journey in AI and ML</p>
